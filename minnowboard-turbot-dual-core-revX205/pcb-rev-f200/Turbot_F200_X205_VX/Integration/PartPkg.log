     Packager     Version: 020806.00

        Commandline is: "C:\MentorGraphics\EEVX.1.1\SDD_HOME\wg\win64\bin\package.exe  -jC:\Users\student\Desktop\Turbot_F200_X202_MGC_Release\Turbot_F200_X202\Turbot_F200_X202.prj -nTurbot -Add -NoFill"

     The Common Database is at "C:\Users\student\Desktop\Turbot_F200_X202_MGC_Release\Turbot_F200_X202\database".

     The Root of this design is "Turbot".

     The Front End Snapshot of this design is "DxD".

     The PCB Design Path of this design is at "C:\Users\student\Desktop\Turbot_F200_X202_MGC_Release\Turbot_F200_X202\PCB\Turbot_F200.pcb".

     The Central Library is at "C:\Users\student\Desktop\Turbot_F200_X202_MGC_Release\Turbot_F200_X202\Minnowmax_Central_Library\Minnowmax_Central_Library.lmc".

     Unable to determine the Disable Repackage status.
     !Repackaging will be allowed!

     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB only for parts not already found in the
      Target PDB.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Part Number pin
      numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
      for unpackaged symbols.

     Properties that have been checked off in the Property Definition Editor
      found at Library Manager/Common Properties will be checked for value
      differences between the PartsDB and the non-null properties on symbols.
     Those properties checked off (other than Part Number)
      will not be transferred from the PartsDB to symbols.
     The following properties were checked off in the Property Definition Editor:
       "Pkg Group"
       "Connector Mating Part"
       "Connector Gender"
       "EPFIXEDWIDTH"
       "EPFIXEDLENGTH"
       "Term"
       "SIM_MODEL"
       "SIM_MODEL_FILE"

      the symbols have identical Part Numbers, or if both Part Numbers are missing,
      then identical Part Names or if they are missing, identical Part Labels.
