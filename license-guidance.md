#MinnowBoard-org/design-files Licensing Guidance:

1. See MinnowBoard.org [Terms of Service](https://www.minnowboard.org/terms-of-service) for detailed wording on our foundation position on licensing and intellectual property rights.
2. Where do I find licenses for these design files?   
 1. To maintain clear association of the license to the corresponding design files our policy is to include a license.txt/.md file directly underneath the corresponding content folder, for a given PCB version of a given product. See the below hierarchy example. 
1. Our intent for the /design-files repo is to work with submitting partners/members to maintain our foundation CC-BY 4.0 goals, however, you may see exceptions. Look carefully. [Contact us](https://www.minnowboard.org/help) with questions.
